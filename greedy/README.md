## Greedy Algorithm

Making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum

Attention:
```
For Np Problem, we don't have the algo to get the best solution yet, we can only use approximation algorithm 
to find a solution close to the best
Greedy algorithm is a good solution as approximated algorithm.
```

Typical NP Problems: 
- Aggregate coverage problem: find the smallest set to cover all the problem.
- Traveling salesman problem: find the best path to go through all the cities listed
